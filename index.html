      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>Since Jul 2019</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">Core Database Engineer</i>,
        <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://www.yellowbrick.com/">Yellowbrick Data</a>, London, UK.<br/>
        Yellowbrick Data is building a Postgres-compatible distributed SQL database that can answer analytical/complex queries over petabytes of data in milliseconds.
        To achieve that, we have our own query planner, we compile queries to machine-code, which then runs on a custom operating system, and custom-built HPC hardware cluster.
      </p>

      <h3>Oct 2016 - Apr 2019 (2 years 7 months)</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">CAM Engine Team Lead</i>,
        <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://cloudnc.com/">CloudNC</a>, London, UK.<br/>
        My team developed autonomous "one-click" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control">toolpath planning</a> and optimization for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_(machining)#Computer_numerical_control">CNC metal milling machines</a>.
        As employee #4, I helped shape the company culture and product.
        I wrote many geometry algorithms that were the foundation for our product.
        I then transitioned into a team lead/management role, where I introduced 1-on-1s, standups, personal development plans and team meetings.
        I helped define the entire interview process: writing job ads, tech screen calls, remote and on-site interviews.
        I was responsible for the software architecture, managing technical debt and introducing development practices such as code reviews and issue tracking.
        I worked together with the team to plan and execute projects.
      </p>

      <h3>Jan 2016 - Oct 2016 (10 months)</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D software engineer</i>,
        <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/">Autodesk Research</a>, London, UK.<br/>
        I worked on <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher">Project Dreamcatcher</a>, a <a href="https://lineshapespace.com/generative-design/">Generative Design</a> CAD tool for topology optimisation, which takes advantage of additive manufacturing (metal 3D printing) methods to produce lightweight, functional products. From a set of user-specified physical constraints and objectives, Dreamcatcher generates thousands of alternative design options using the power of cloud-computing and GPU acceleration. The user can then visualise and explore trade-offs, and select an optimal solution.
        My main contributions were: building reusable components for design, simulation and optimisation of <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/within/overview">lattice infill</a>, and development of topology optimisation using the Finite-Element Method.
      </p>

      <h3>Feb 2015 - Jan 2016 (1 year)</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D / Scrum Master</i>,
        <a itemprop="worksFor" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/professional/">Bloomberg LP</a>, London, UK.<br/>
        I worked in the Shared Services (middleware) team for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/">Trading Systems</a> division. We built an asynchronous, multi-threaded, cloud-based API that consolidated access to ﬁnancial data across different sources and interfacing with multiple teams.
        I helped my team adopt Agile, beyond being an individual contributor I was also responsible for task prioritization, testing, continuous integration, build and version control. I was part of the interview team for senior-level recruitment.
      </p>

      <h3>Sep 2011 - Jan 2015 (3 years 5 months)</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D engineer</i>,
        <a href="http://www.synopsys.com">Synopsys</a>, Dublin, Ireland.<br/>
        I worked on <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/signoff/primetime.html">PrimeTime</a>, a static timing analysis tool that computes worst-case propagation delays and checks timing constraints to ensure signal integrity of electronic circuits before sign-off for manufacture.
        My role was focused on optimization.
        I was tasked with constantly searching for opportunities for performance improvements through profiling and similar techniques. I had an extensive exposure to PrimeTime very large C++ code base. As a result of these investigations, I directly proposed and lead multiple projects from idea to completion.
        These projects included multi-threading, low-level optimisations to our memory allocators, deployment of inlining and algorithmic complexity enhancements to various areas. I had a central role as a reference in C++ within the team. During our product-wide migration from C to C++, I was trusted with refreshing our coding guidelines. I gave regular talks on C++ topics to the rest of the team, and I also took part in interviews and ramp-up of new hires.

        <i>R&amp;D engineer</i> (part-time during my Ph.D),
        <a href="http://www.st.com">STMicroelectronics</a>, Grenoble, France.<br/>
        I worked on transactional-level modelling, a technique for
        early architecture exploration and simulation of embedded systems.
        I directly supervised three Master-level students during their
        6-month, last-year projects.
