        <a itemprop="worksFor" href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/">Autodesk Research</a>, London, UK.<br/>
        I worked on <a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher">Project Dreamcatcher</a>, a <a href="https://lineshapespace.com/generative-design/">Generative Design</a> CAD tool for topology optimisation, which takes advantage of additive manufacturing (metal 3D printing) methods to produce lightweight, functional products. From a set of user-specified physical constraints and objectives, Dreamcatcher generates thousands of alternative design options using the power of cloud-computing and GPU acceleration. The user can then visualise and explore trade-offs, and select an optimal solution.
        My main contributions were: building reusable components for design, simulation and optimisation of <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/within/overview">lattice infill</a>, and development of topology optimisation using the Finite-Element Method.

        I worked in the Shared Services (middleware) team for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/product/asset-and-investment-manager/">Trading Systems</a> division. We built an asynchronous, multi-threaded, cloud-based API that consolidated access to ﬁnancial data across different sources and interfacing with multiple teams.
        I helped my team adopt Agile, beyond being an individual contributor I was also responsible for task prioritization, testing, continuous integration, build and version control. I was part of the interview team for senior-level recruitment.

      <h3>Sep 2011 - Jan 2015 (3 years 5 months)</h3>
      <p>
        <i itemprop="jobTitle">Senior R&amp;D engineer</i>,
        <a href="http://www.synopsys.com">Synopsys</a>, Dublin, Ireland.<br/>
        I worked on <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/implementation-and-signoff/signoff/primetime.html">PrimeTime</a>, a static timing analysis tool that computes worst-case propagation delays and checks timing constraints to ensure signal integrity of electronic circuits before sign-off for manufacture.
        My role was focused on optimization.
        I was tasked with constantly searching for opportunities for performance improvements through profiling and similar techniques. I had an extensive exposure to PrimeTime very large C++ code base. As a result of these investigations, I directly proposed and lead multiple projects from idea to completion.
        These projects included multi-threading, low-level optimisations to our memory allocators, deployment of inlining and algorithmic complexity enhancements to various areas. I had a central role as a reference in C++ within the team. During our product-wide migration from C to C++, I was trusted with refreshing our coding guidelines. I gave regular talks on C++ topics to the rest of the team, and I also took part in interviews and ramp-up of new hires.
